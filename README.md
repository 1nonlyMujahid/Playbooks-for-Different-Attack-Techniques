This project was done in a group where we had to make a playbook for different attack techniques that are used a lot by attackers in today's world.

**Playbooks were made for:**
1. Command and Control
2. Credential Stuffing
3. Local Privilege Escalation
4. Malicious Drivers

Each playbook contains how the data can be classified, what the processes can look like, and what the different phases in the response procedure are.
